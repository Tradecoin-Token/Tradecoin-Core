# TRD Core integration/staging repository</b><br>
TRD is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions using the Quark Algo, with low transaction fees & environmental footprint. It utilizes the first ever anonymous proof of stake protocol, combined with regular PoS and masternodes for securing its network. PoS incentivises using the privacy features available in TRD by granting a higher block reward for PoS over regular PoS and masternodes. In practice TRD will have higher use of it's privacy features in comparison to other coins that combine public and private transactions. The goal of TRD is to achieve a decentralized sustainable crypto currency with near instant full-time private transactions, fair governance and community intelligence.
